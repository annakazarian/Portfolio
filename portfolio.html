            <h1>Theme 1: Web Design</h1>
            <p>The first theme was about developing our first website.<br> Develop a responsive website through iterative processes and by implementing basic design principles,<br> valid code and practices for user interface design, user experiences and visual design of a website.<br> Learn how to work with Brackets, Cyberduck, how to use validate and debug HTML and CSS<br> according to current web standards using W3C Validators, inspect and text your code using Developer Tools(Google Chrome).<br> Overall, looking at my first repsonsive website, I did everything i understood at the beginning,<br> but time pass by and now i can see my mistakes.I have not used flexible grids, flexible images and media queries to make overall layout responsive.<br><br>Take a look at my project <a href="http://nyarazak.dk/RESPONSIVE/index.html" target="_blank">here.</a>

        <h1>Theme 2: Basic Animation</h1><br>
        <p>In these theme we mostly learned how to get hand in hand with Adobe Illustrator.<br> Create animations via CSS, Javascript and Illustrator. First project is a storytelling & animation,where learned 12 principles of animation,<br> drew sketches, import them and afterwards use animation frames to get the work done.
            Second one was basically one of the first group projects.<br> The task was to recreate some scenes of the movie in received style. Our movie was - Rare Window.<br> It was requierd to draw all the backgrounds and characters in Illustrator. Everybody in the group had their one responsibility and mine was <br> to draw the characters. I followed image Trace tutorial video filmed by one of our teachers and found it very helpful.<br>You can see some of the projects down bellow.<br>

        <h1>Theme 3: Basic Content</h1>
        <p> In this module we were expected to produce 2 short videos.<br>First a short story on mobile phones and second an information video <br>for an external collaboration partner (Bikes in Copenhagen). <br>We worked with tools like treatment and storyboard in order to professionalise the field work and be more precise with our target group.<br> Borrowed a lot of equipment from Tech Lounge in order to film as proffesional as possible. My role in this group was to film,work with a storyboard and moodboard,be the voiceover and write the script.<br> Being a voiceover was new and amazing experience, as we recorded at the KEA mini recording booth.<br><br>

        <h1>Theme 4: Basic UX </h1>
        <p> The main idea of this project was to create the new improved Fronter app.<br> This project was mostly focused on basic UX. We took part in group work in the later parts of the Design Sprint and created a Team Canvas.<br> Worked individual on developing a digital user interface as well as took part in a group work during the process.<br> Project work designed a solution based on a client and user brief.<br> It took a lot of patience to learn how to document every design proccess and implement it in the prototypes.<br><br>
